				<h3>Summary of Methods Used & Justification</h3>
				The first method that we used in our study was the "Conceptual Landscape Method." In this approach, we instructed
				interviewees to visually illustrate their ideal user interface that would cater to their specific needs. After each
				interviewee created their basic diagram, we proceeded to ask about the rationale behind including each individual
				feature in their sketch. We choose this method due to the abundance of social media applications available in the
				market, each offering various features. Our aim was to gain
				insight into users' preferences and immediate thoughts when prompted to design a user interface that aligns with their
				desires. <br><br>
				The second method that we used was the ‚ÄúPersonal Inventory.‚Äù In this approach, we create detailed user personas by
				interviewing and collecting information about users' preferences, pain points, and motivations. We decided to use this
				method because it will help us understand which features or aspects of a product are most important to users and should
				be prioritized in design and development. Through asking our interviewees questions, we gathered personal inventory data
				to iterate on the future product, also improving the future product based on interviewees‚Äô feedback and reported
				experiences with other social media platforms.<br><br>
				The third method that we used was "A Day in the Life Method.‚Äù This approach involved assigning each team member the task
				of shadowing a selected interviewee for an entire day, with certain instances allowing for a partial day of observation.
				During these immersive experiences, we closely observed the interviewees' usage patterns, with a particular focus on
				their most frequently utilized social media platforms. The rationale behind adopting this method was to gain the most
				accurate and insightful understanding of user behavior and feature preferences. Through direct observation of our
				interviewee‚Äôs interaction with various features in various applications in the context of their daily lives, we aimed to
				uncover nuanced insights that may not be readily apparent through traditional surveys or interviews alone. This hands-on
				approach allowed us to bridge the gap between user feedback and real-world behavior.<br>
				
				</p>

				<p>
					<h3>Summary of Findings</h3>
					<b>1. Pain points/ Frustration</b> <br>
					Through our meticulous observation and in-depth interviews, we have identified 7 user pain points within the current
					landscape of applications. The most frequently used applications, such as Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok, Wechat, and RED,
					have been the focus of our research. Our findings reveal that while users appreciate certain features in each of these
					apps, none of them completely satisfy their needs. Consequently, users are inconvenienced by the necessity to switch
					between multiple social media platforms.
					One significant pain point we discovered is users' desire to segregate posts from celebrities or influencers from those
					of their friends. For instance, on Instagram, users follow a diverse range of people, ranging from friends and alumni to
					celebrities. However, all posts are displayed together on the home page, even when users may only want to view content
					from specific groups. Regrettably, there is currently no feature available to facilitate this level of customization or
					filtering. <br><br>
					Another prominent user pain point is the inadequacy of the recommendation systems in place. Users often struggle to find
					relevant content when searching for specific keywords or interests. This shortfall in content discovery hinders the
					overall user experience. <br><br>
					
					Many users feel a lack of real interaction between friends and communities. A recurring sentiment among interviewees was
					the perception of superficial connections through social media interactions. It often appears that likes, shares, and
					comments have taken precedence over fostering meaningful connections. It is apparent that there‚Äôs a desire for
					interactions that are genuinely authentic and go beyond the surface level.
					Furthermore, concerns regarding user privacy were raised. Data breaches have happened on many social media platforms in
					the past years as software development rapidly grows. As this technological growth happens, users are increasingly
					worried about misuse of their personal information.<br><br>
					<b>2. Goal of Users</b> <br>
					To address the user pain points mentioned earlier, we have identified 5 key objectives that we are committed to
					addressing and what we believe are the goals of our potential users.
					First, we aim to introduce a customizable content filtering feature, enabling users to easily categorize and access
					posts from specific groups. This will empower users to curate their feeds in alignment with their individual
					preferences. <br><br>
					Secondly, we hope to enhance the current state of art recommendation systems to provide users with more personalized
					content suggestions, ensuring that the content offered aligns better with their interests and preferences.<br>
					Third, we strive to improve user experience by giving them plenty of privacy options, to strengthen user privacy and
					security measures to protect user data and build trust. Provide robust privacy settings and educate users about them.<br>
					Fourth, we will prevent users from getting overwhelmed by the overloaded information by develop features that help users
					manage and filter the overwhelming amount of content on social media, such as customizable filters, topic
					prioritization, or "mute" options.<br><br>
					Fifth, we hope our users will find a sense of belonging in their community, by foster a sense of community through
					features like groups, forums, or events. Encourage meaningful interactions, discussions, and collaborations among users.<br><br>
					Furthermore, fostering authentic interactions among users. To achieve this, we plan to introduce features such as
					discussion forums, community groups, and other features that prioritize content from close friends and family in users'
					feeds. We are also exploring innovative solutions like location sharing and 'close friend bumps' to promote meaningful
					connections when friends are in proximity.<br><br>
					Last but not least, we are committed to implementing robust privacy controls and transparent data handling practices. We
					recognize the significance of protecting user data, and we will continue to prioritize data security and user privacy as
					integral aspects of our new social media application.<br><br>
		
					
					<b>3. Context of Use</b> <br>
					In our user research process for social media apps, we discovered that the context of use refers to the specific
					situations or scenarios in which users interact with the application. Understanding these contexts is vital for us to
					create a seamless and user-friendly experience. By thoroughly understanding these various contexts of use, we can create
					experiences that are more relevant, engaging, and enjoyable for our diverse user base. Here are the four points we
					learned from our research. <br><br>
					First, we have to consider how users engage with the app on different devices. Mobile users may have different needs and
					preferences compared to those using a desktop or laptop.<br><br>
					Second is the location when users are engaged in social media. Take into account where users are accessing the app. Most
					interviewees used social media in several locations, which can impact the type of content they seek and how they
					interact with others.<br><br>
					Third is the time of day, where timing also influences the user behavior. This can vary throughout the day. For
					instance, some users might be more active during their lunch break or in the evening. Therefore, we can tailor content
					and notifications accordingly.<br><br>
					Fourth is the privacy concerns that users often encounter when registering an account. Users have different comfort
					levels with sharing personal information. We need to respect their privacy preferences and provide clear options for
					controlling data sharing.<br><br>
